# Decisions

## Integration of code style tools in framework <a id="integration-of-code-style-tools-in-framework"></a>

**ID**: 001  
**Status**: Decided  
**Date**: 2023/11/13  
**Context**:
We need static code analysis tools for:

- unified code standard in the framework
- better code readability
- easy code formatting actions

**Proposed solution**

- ESLint for linting coding rules for TypeScript files
- Prettier for formatting files
- Husky for running linting scripts

**Pros**: Tools automate formatting and code style maintenance activities

**Cons**: New tools add more complexity to the solution and require maintenance

**Decision**: Use Prettier, ESLint, and Husky to provide high code standard across the framework

## Use of dotenv in automated tests <a id="use-of-dotenv-in-automated-tests"></a>

**ID**: 002  
**Status**: Decided  
**Date**: 2023/11/20  
**Context**: We need a reliable way to manage environment-specific configurations, such as passwords, API keys, database connections, and other sensitive information.

**Proposed solution**: Utilize the 'dotenv' library in our automated tests.

**Pros**:

- Secure configuration management - dotenv allows us to store sensitive information like API keys and passwords in a separate file (e.g., .env) and keeps them out of version control, enhancing security.
- Simplified environment setup - with dotenv, we can easily switch between different environments (e.g., development, staging, production) without modifying test code, leading to more flexibility and ease of use.
- Improved collaboration - developers and testers can have their own .env files with custom configurations, making it easier to collaborate on the same test suite with different setups.
- Enhanced test portability - since dotenv decouples configurations from the code, the same test suite can be used across different environments and machines effortlessly.

**Cons**:

- Extra setup steps - integrating dotenv into our testing framework requires initial setup, including installing the library and ensuring that the .env files are correctly managed.
- Potential for misconfiguration - if .env files are not managed properly or if they contain errors, it may lead to test failures or unexpected behavior during test execution.

**Decision**: Decided

## Use of design patterns like POM, AAA, and composition in automated tests <a id="use-of-design-patterns-like-pom-aaa-and-composition-in-automated-tests"></a>

**ID**: 003  
**Status**: Decided  
**Date**: 2023/11/20  
**Context**: As our automated test suite grows, we face challenges in maintaining test code readability, reusability, and scalability. We are considering adopting design patterns to improve the overall test structure and maintainability.

**Proposed solution**: Implement the Page Object Model (POM) for UI tests, Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern for tests, and Composition for creating modular and flexible test components.

**Pros**:

- **Page Object Model (POM)**:

  - Enhanced test organization - POM allows us to structure UI test code by creating separate classes for each web page, resulting in a more organized and readable test suite.
  - Improved test maintenance - Changes to the UI can be localized within the page class, reducing the impact on test code and speeding up maintenance efforts.
  - Reusability - POM promotes reusing page methods across different tests, leading to a more efficient test development process.

- **Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA)**:

  - Clear test structure - AAA separates test code into three distinct sections, making it easier to understand the test's setup, action, and verification steps.
  - Better error localization - With AAA, it is simpler to pinpoint the cause of test failures, aiding in quicker issue resolution.
  - Facilitates testing best practices - AAA aligns with the principles of testing, encouraging developers to write more reliable and robust tests.

- **Composition**:
  - Modular test components - Using composition allows us to build test scenarios by assembling smaller, reusable building blocks, enhancing test maintainability.
  - Flexible test design - By composing test components, we can easily create different test combinations and scenarios, promoting test coverage and adaptability.

**Cons**:

- **Page Object Model (POM)**:

  - Initial setup overhead - Implementing POM may require additional effort in creating page classes and refactoring existing test code.
  - Potential overhead for small projects - In smaller projects with limited UI testing, POM may introduce unnecessary complexity.

- **Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA)**:

  - Learning curve - Developers unfamiliar with AAA might require some time to adapt to the new testing pattern.

- **Composition**:
  - Complexity management - While composition promotes modularity, if not properly managed, it can lead to an overly complex test structure.
  - Abstraction balance - Overuse of composition might obscure the underlying test logic, making it harder to understand the test flow.

**Decision**: Decided. We will adopt the Page Object Model (POM) for UI tests, Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern for tests.

## Use of faker in automated tests <a id="use-of-faker-in-automated-tests"></a>

**ID**: 004
**Status**: Decided
**Date**: 2023/11/20
**Context**: In our automated tests, we often encounter the need to populate test data with realistic but randomized values, such as names, addresses, dates, and other user-specific information.

**Proposed solution**: Integrate the 'faker' library into our automated tests to generate realistic and randomized test data.

**Pros**:

- Realistic test data - The 'faker' library provides a wide range of data generation options, allowing us to create diverse and realistic test scenarios.
- Time-saving - Automating the data generation process with 'faker' significantly reduces the time spent on writing and maintaining test data setup.
- Increased test coverage - By using 'faker,' we can easily create various data combinations, enhancing our test suite's coverage.

**Cons**:

- Dependency management - We need to ensure that the 'faker' library is correctly installed and managed across our test environments.
- Slower tests - Adding faker slows down test by additional logic and abstraction.
- Random Data Challenges - Random data produced by faker, in some cases can be inappropriate for our needs, that force additional effort to customize faker outputs.

**Decision**: Decided.

## Introduction of New Methods Returning Page Objects in Page Objects Code <a id="introduction-of-new-methods-returning-page-objects"></a>

**ID**: 005  
**Status**: Decided  
**Date**: 2024/01/19  
**Context**: As our automation framework evolves, we are introducing a new pattern for our page objects code. This pattern involves the creation of methods within page objects that return new page objects for improved test flow and maintainability.

**Proposed solution**: Implement a pattern where methods within page objects return new page objects upon interaction. This approach enhances the organization of our test code and promotes better test maintainability.

**Pros**:

- Improved test readability - By returning new page objects, the test flow becomes more intuitive and self-explanatory, making it easier for team members to understand and contribute to test scripts.
- Enhanced page object reusability - This pattern encourages the reuse of existing page methods and objects, reducing code duplication and promoting consistency across tests.
- Modular test development - The ability to chain page object methods allows for the creation of modular and flexible test scenarios, enhancing test design.

**Cons**:

- Learning curve - Team members may need some time to become familiar with this pattern, especially if they are accustomed to different approaches.
- Initial refactoring - Adapting existing page objects to this pattern may require some refactoring effort, which should be considered during implementation.

**Decision**: Decided
